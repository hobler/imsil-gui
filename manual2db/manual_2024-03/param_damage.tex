\begin{keydescription}{\texttt{DAMSAT} --- Damage saturation concentration}

  This parameter specifies the damage saturation concentration. The damage
  concentrations may not exceed \texttt{DAMSAT} unless

  saturation and amorphization.  This means that in a monatomic target the
  interstitial and vacancy concentrations will asymptotically approach
  \texttt{DAMSAT} if the density equals \texttt{DENSITY}.  Likewise, if the

  The radiation induced diffusivity equals $\frac{1}{6}\lambda^2 k$

  This parameter specifies the maximum distance from the surface where recoils
  are followed down to energies lower than \texttt{EF} when \texttt{LSPUT=T}. 
  For distances from the surface less than \texttt{DNEAR}/2, they are followed 
  down to \texttt{ESURF}. For distances between \texttt{DNEAR}/2 and
  \texttt{DNEAR} the cutoff energy is interpolated linearly. Also, within 
  \texttt{DNEAR} from the surface virtual recoils are generated
  (see Section~\ref{s:sput}). Smaller values of \texttt{DNEAR} speed up
  the simulation, but too small values artificially reduce the sputtering 
  yield if $\texttt{ESURF} < \texttt{EF}$. The units are \AA.

  corners may be moved during relaxation. In converting damage energy into 
  displacements per atom the modified Kinchin-Pease model is used. The units of 
  \texttt{DPARELAX} are 1. Note that the energy density accumulated depends on 
  the implanted dose between relaxations. This dose equals 
  \texttt{DOSE*NIONUPD/NION} with \texttt{DOSE} and \texttt{NION} from the

    Pease model}

  This parameter specifies the energy limit in eV below which the
  recoil trajectories are terminated and damage is calculated according to the 
  modified Kinchin Pease model. As a cutoff energy, \texttt{ELIMKP} operates 
  in addition to \texttt{EF},
  i.e., trajectories are terminated if their energy is either less than 
  \texttt{ELIMKP} or \texttt{EF}. The default value of 0 thus means that 
  recoils are followed down to \texttt{EF}. \texttt{ELIMKP} is not applied to 
  externally started ions. It is set to zero if \texttt{LCAP=T} or

  This parameter specifies the energy per target atom in eV needed to

\begin{keydescription}{\texttt{LRCOIL1} --- Recoil cascade before reentering
flag}
%
  This parameter specifies whether projectiles with the reentered flag unset can
  generate recoils whose trajectories are followed. The reentered flag is
  set if a projectile or one of its parents has been emitted from a surface
  and has reentered the target at a different point in space. The reentered flag
  is always unset in a cartesian 1D simulation. Note that for recoils to be
  followed at all, also \texttt{LRCOIL=T} is required. The purpose of
  \texttt{LRCOIL1} is to provide the possibility of switching off recoil
  generation before reentering while keeping recoil generation after by setting
  \texttt{LRCOIL=T}, \texttt{LRCOIL1=F}, \texttt{LRCOIL2=T}.
